Handwritten Multi Digit Recognition With Machine Learning
Over the last four decades computers and related technology have become an increasingly integral part of our daily lives. Considerable time and effort has been spent to increase the accuracy and utility of computer algorithms on many tasks. Fueled by an explosion in the data we can collect, machine learning algorithms have become high-demand algorithms in recent years. Offline handwritten digit recognition is a well-known problem that remains at best partially solved. This work presents a study of three different algorithms for offline handwritten multi digit recognition using the MNIST dataset: Decision Trees, Multilayer Perceptrons and Random Forest. Our results indicate that Random Forest had the best accuracy at 96\% with reasonable runtime performance. In this work we developed a mechanism for reading multi-digit numbers from image files and webcams that may be of interest.
